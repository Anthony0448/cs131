# The total grade sum is found by doing a += for each line of the csv in an associated array where the index is the student name (column $2)
# The average grade is found by making a function that takes in 3 parameters that correspond to the student scores in each columns. These are stored in an associated array
# Checking if a student failed or passed is done by doing an if else statement check in the associated array of the average grade
