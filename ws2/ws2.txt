1. ws2 directory is stored in ~/cs131/

2. /home/anthony_flores
My home directory path is /home/anthony_flores. I found this out by using the 'pwd' command to
list the path of my current directory after 'cd ~' and saw that it was within the home directory.

3.
My UID is 1001. I found this out using the command 'id'

uid=1001(anthony_flores) gid=1002(anthony_flores) groups=1002(anthony_flores),4(adm),20(dialout),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),118(netdev),119(lxd),1000(ubuntu),1001(google-sudoers)

I am part of many groups, which include: adm, dialout, cdrom, floppy, etc...
I found this out by also using the 'id' command but with the -Gn flag.

anthony_flores adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev netdev lxd ubuntu google-sudoers

This is using 'id -G' which has the group ID numbers.
1002 4 20 24 25 29 30 44 46 118 119 1000 1001

4. By using ls | grep mem and grep cpu I was able to find information on the memory and cpu in /proc/meminfo and /proc/cpuinfo.

5. Here is the memory information of the server given by 'head'.
The total memory on the server is 976896 kB or about 978 MB

MemTotal:         976896 kB
MemFree:          530524 kB
MemAvailable:     615544 kB
Buffers:           11632 kB
Cached:           184648 kB
SwapCached:            0 kB

Inactive:         152096 kB
Active(anon):        896 kB
Inactive(anon):    67636 kB

6. Using 'head /proc/cpuinfo' I was able to determine that the CPU on the server has 1 processor. After looking up some help on Google I found that if the cpu has flags that contain "lm" then it is a x64 bit architecture. I further confirmed this by the command 'uname -m'. This server uses x86_64 architecture of AMD64
. By using 'head proc/cpuinfo I was able to determine that the processor has a 2.20GHz speed. 

processor	: 0
vendor_id	: GenuineIntel
cpu family	: 6
model		: 79
model name	: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.20GHz
stepping	: 0
microcode	: 0xffffffff
cpu MHz		: 2199.998
cache size	: 56320 KB
physical id	: 0
