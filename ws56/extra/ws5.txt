Commands used for Task 1
sed -n '/^2\.0/ p' ~/cs131/2019-01-h1.csv
1. -n dictates
2. Enclose the sed instructions in single quotes
3. The enclosing slashes are used for the instructions /inst/
4. ^2\.0 Specifies to match (implied) the start of the line '2.0'
5. The p at the end of the single quotes tells sed to print all the lines

2)
For substitution with sed to remove delimiters
The syntax for substitution with $ sed is:  s/pattern/replacement/flags

$ sed 's/[:"-]//g' ~/cs131/2019-01-h1.csv

1. The 's/' in the beginning is to initiate substitution
2. The g at the end is to make the instructions global and not just change the first instance per line
# Remember, character classes [xyz] should be used when we want to match any one character from the set
3. Within the character class we match the delimiter symvols
4. Another slash follows the character class for the substitution part which is empty since we are removing '//'

3)
Removing the fractional parts of all numbers

$ sed 's/\.[0-9]*//g' ~/cs131/ws56/no-separators.csv

1. \.[0-9] matches all input that begins with a period and is followed by some numbers 0 or more times '*'
Without the * the regex would only match values with a single digit
